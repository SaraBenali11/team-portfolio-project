## Team Retrospective Analysis

### 1. Technical Challenge
Throughout our collaborative workflow, the most significant technical challenge we encountered was maintaining synchronization between multiple feature branches during active development. Each member was assigned a specific component of the website, and as progress advanced, differences in file structures and dependencies began to cause merge conflicts. Coordinating simultaneous updates while ensuring that no oneâ€™s work was overwritten required both strong communication and a structured Git workflow. We realized the importance of following a consistent branching model and committing frequently with clear messages to prevent confusion.

### 2. Merge Conflict Resolution
One specific merge conflict occurred when integrating the feature branches into the develop branch. Two contributors had modified the same section of the main App.js fileâ€”one added routing elements while another updated the header structure. Git flagged the conflict, and we manually opened the file to inspect both code versions. After a short discussion on Discord, we decided to combine both updates: we kept the new routing structure and merged the improved header component within it. Once resolved, we staged the corrected file, committed the changes, and successfully merged into develop. This experience helped the whole team better understand how Git tracks changes and how conflicts arise.

### 3. Evaluation of the Pull Request and Peer Review Process
The pull request (PR) and peer review process played a key role in improving the overall quality of our final artifact. Each PR served as a checkpoint for validationâ€”team members reviewed each otherâ€™s work, identified small bugs, and suggested visual or code improvements before merging. This prevented major integration issues later and ensured a clean, functional main branch ready for deployment. Moreover, this process encouraged collaboration, accountability, and better documentation habits. By the end of the project, our workflow became much more structured and efficient, mirroring a real-world software development environment.
