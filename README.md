## ðŸ§  Team Retrospective Analysis

### 1. Technical Challenge 
The biggest challenge was Git chaos and merge conflict nightmares. We started with everyone pushing directly to main, then switched to branches, but nobody synced properly. Files kept disappearing, links broke, and we spent more time fixing Git issues than coding. Half the team didn't understand branching, so we had people working on wrong branches, committing to develop instead of features, and creating merge conflicts in index.html every single time someone tried to add their link. We learned the hard way that Git doesn't forgive mistakes.

### 2. Merge Conflict Resolution 
The worst conflict happened when three people edited index.html simultaneously. Sara added her link, Besmala pushed hers, and Kahina tried to merge â€“ resulting in `<<<<<<< HEAD` hell. The file had duplicate links, broken anchors, and missing team members. We had to manually compare all versions on Discord screenshots, rebuild the entire navigation from scratch, and force push to fix the mess. It took 2 hours to resolve what should have been a 2-minute change. We learned to always `git pull origin develop` before touching shared files.

### 3. Pull Request Process 
The PR review process was chaotic at first â€“ people would approve without checking, merge to wrong branches, or forget to request reviews. We had PRs sitting for days without attention. But once we established rules (2 approvals required, specific reviewers tagged), quality improved dramatically. Teammates caught broken links, suggested better designs, and found missing images. The process forced us to actually look at each other's code instead of just rushing to finish. It was painful but necessary for a professional final product.
